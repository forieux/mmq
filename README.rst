===

MMQ provides Majorize-Minimize Quadratic optimization algorithms.

Features
--------

- The `mmmg`, Majorize-Minimize Memory Gradient algorithm.
- No restriction on the number of regularizer, input shape, ...
- Base class for criterion.
- Several classical criterion like Huber, Geman & McClure, ...
- Comes with exemples of linear operator.

Installation
------------

No installation procedure have been implemented at that time. To install, just
