======================
 Q-MM's documentation
======================

Q-MM is a small Python toolbox to optimise differentiable criterion

.. math::
   \hat x = \underset{x \in \mathbb{R}}{\text{arg min}}\ J(x)

by Majorization-Minimization with quadratic surrogate function. In particular,
**no linesearch** is necessary and **close form formula for the step** are used
with guaranteed convergence. The explicit step formula allows fast convergence
of the algorithm to a minimiser with minimal tuning parameters. However, the
criterion must meet the conditions, see :doc:`Background <background>`.

Features
========

- The ``mmmg`` (or `3mg`), Majorize-Minimize Memory Gradient algorithm.
- The ``mmcg``, Majorize-Minimize Conjugate Gradient algorithm.
- *No linesearch*: the step is obtained from a close form formula.
- *No conjugacy choice*: a conjugacy strategy is not necessary thanks to the
  subspace nature of the algorithms. The ``mmcg`` algorithm use a Polak-Ribi√®re
  formula.
- Generic and flexible: there is no restriction on the number of regularizer,
  their type, .., as well as for data adequacy.
- Provided base class for criterion allowing easier and fast implementation.
- Comes with examples of implemented linear operator.
